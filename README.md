# Piston-Bottle
Bottle that pours soda with no air intake. Meant to prevent 2-L bottle soda from going flat in 1 day. 
Spring designed to hold weight of liquid from 0-2 liters. 
Spring extends as liquid is poured and stays up when bottle is upright. 
Spring designed with ASTM-227 1.04mm-diameter wire. 

Notes:
Not marketable, cost is too high (material usage and shaping). 
Personal project for self-education of Solidworks and materials and machine design. 
Creation of a spring with (mean diameter)/(wire diameter) ratio of 38 is far beyond cost effectiveness. 
Spring with smaller C-ratio means larger (free length)/(mean diameter) ratio, causing buckling at max compression. 
  => problem solved with spring guides from top and bottom as shown in video => creates additional cost.
