# Piston-Bottle
Bottle that pours soda with no air intake. Meant to prevent 2-L bottle soda from going flat in 1 day. 
Spring designed to hold weight of liquid from 0-2 liters. 
Spring extends as liquid is poured and stays up when bottle is upright. 
Spring designed with ASTM-227 1.04mm-diameter wire. 

Notes:
Not marketable, cost is too high (material usage and shaping). 
Personal project for self-education of Solidworks and materials and machine design. 
Creation of a spring with (mean diameter)/(wire diameter) ratio of 38 is far beyond cost effective manufacturing. 
Spring with smaller C-ratio means larger (free length)/(mean diameter) ratio, causing buckling at max compression. 
  => problem solved with spring guides from top and bottom as shown in video => creates additional cost. 
It wouldn't work the way it is because it would need a strong syringe-like tightness to hold that much liquid, and that's too much friction for the syringe to move from the spring. It might require the liquid to be bagged inside. An easier solution is a gatorade cooler-shaped dispenser where the lid simply sinks as liquid is poured out
